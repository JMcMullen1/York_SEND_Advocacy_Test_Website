      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>York SEND Advocacy was founded in 2020 by a group of parents, educators, and legal professionals who recognized the need for independent support for families navigating the SEND system in York. What began as a small volunteer effort has grown into a trusted organisation helping dozens of families each year. We are rooted in the local community and driven by a passion to ensure every child's needs are met and rights respected.</p>
