            <p>Most work is billed in 15-minute increments with a minimum of 1 hour on new matters.

            <div class="pricing-faq-a">
              <div class="pricing-faq-a-inner">No. Our fixed-fee packages are one-off pieces of work with a clear start and finish. For tribunal cases, our staged pricing means you can pause or stop at the end of any stage — you're never locked into the full case if your situation changes or your case settles early.</div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="pricing-faq-item fade-in fade-in-delay-1">
            <button class="pricing-faq-q" onclick="this.parentElement.classList.toggle('open')">Can I pay in instalments?</button>
            <div class="pricing-faq-a">
              <div class="pricing-faq-a-inner">Yes. Fixed-fee packages are split 50/50 (half on booking, half on delivery). For packages over &pound;1,000, we can spread the cost across three monthly instalments. Interest-free payment plans are available on request — just ask when you book.</div>
            </div>

            <button class="pricing-faq-q" onclick="this.parentElement.classList.toggle('open')">Is this legal representation?</button>
            <div class="pricing-faq-a">
              <div class="pricing-faq-a-inner">We are not solicitors. We provide specialist SEND advocacy, case support, and tribunal preparation. Where agreed, we can act as your named representative at the SEND Tribunal — meaning the tribunal communicates with us and we can represent you at the hearing. We are not authorised to represent clients in the High Court. For judicial review proceedings, we will support with preparation and signpost you to a solicitor or barrister.</div>

            <div class="pricing-faq-a">
              <div class="pricing-faq-a-inner">We'll always tell you before doing any work beyond the agreed scope. If your case needs more time, we'll discuss your options — whether that's moving to a capped tribunal package, booking additional hourly support, or adjusting the plan. You'll never receive a surprise invoice.</div>

            <div class="pricing-faq-a">
              <div class="pricing-faq-a-inner">Yes. We offer both virtual and in-person meeting attendance. There's no travel charge within the York local area. For locations further afield, we charge travel time at &pound;55/hour (beyond 30 minutes each way) and mileage at 45p per mile. We'll always agree travel costs with you before the meeting.</div>

            <div class="pricing-faq-a">
              <div class="pricing-faq-a-inner">We're based in York, but most of our work is delivered remotely and we support families across the country. SEND law is national, so your location doesn't limit the support we can provide. For in-person meetings outside the local area, travel costs apply.</div>

            <div class="pricing-faq-a">
              <div class="pricing-faq-a-inner">Many of the families we work with resolve their issues without ever reaching a hearing. Our EHCP Health Check, annual review support, and EHCNA packages are all designed to strengthen your position before things escalate. If a tribunal does become necessary, you'll already have a strong foundation to build on.</div>

              <div class="pricing-faq-a-inner">For most packages, we can begin within a few working days of receiving your deposit and documents.
