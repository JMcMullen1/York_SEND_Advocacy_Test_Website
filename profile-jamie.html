            <span class="section-label">SEND Advocate</span>
            <h2>Experienced. Independent. Family-Focused.</h2>
            <p>I have worked in SEND for over 10 years, and my route into it was a bit unconventional. I originally set up a boxing gym in Bradford, which grew into an award-winning Alternative Provision supporting young people who were struggling in mainstream education. From there, I moved into consultancy for Alternative Provisions and went on to lead multiple EOTAS-style provisions, alongside working as a SEND consultant and advocate supporting families through EHCPs, appeals, and wider disputes with Local Authorities.</p>
            <p>That journey &mdash; from grassroots youth work to independent advocacy &mdash; gives me a thorough understanding of how the SEND system operates, and where it fails families. I have worked both within Local Authorities and as an independent consultant, and I have supported families through some of the most complex cases, including those involving medical needs, neurodivergence, school refusal and exploitation. My approach is grounded in SEND law, driven by empathy, and focused entirely on achieving the right outcomes for children and young people.</p>
            <p>I am completely independent. I do not work for any Local Authority, school or health provider. My only interest is ensuring your child receives what the law says they should.</p>

            <h2>What I Bring to Your Family</h2>
            <p>I understand how overwhelming and isolating the SEND system can feel, particularly when you have been let down before. Many of the families I work with have experienced years of inadequate provision, broken promises, and a system that feels stacked against them.</p>
            <p>I bring deep SEND law expertise, practical Tribunal and mediation experience, and a proven ability to hold Local Authorities to account. I combine this with genuine empathy and a commitment to person-centred, lawful practice.</p>
            <p>Whether you need help understanding an EHCP, preparing for a Tribunal, or designing an EOTAS package that actually works for your child, I will work alongside you to make sure the system delivers what it should.</p>
